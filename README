dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


dmenu-v
-------
dmenu-v adds two more switches and integrates the mouse support patch.
dmenu-v can be used as a drop-in replacement for vanilla dmenu.

The following options have been added:

  -w factor

limits the menu width by setting it to a fraction of the (Xinerama)
screen width. Thus, 0.0 < factor <= 1.0.

  -w 0.2

will set the menu width to 1/5th of the screen width. The default factor
is of course 1.0 (use the full screen width).

  -g gravity

makes the menu appear in different locations on the screen. The option
argument is a two-letter string:

  <vertical alignment><horizontal alignment>

where the alignment codes are as follows:

  +--------------------------------+
  | tl            tc            tr |
  |                                |
  | Tl            Tc            Tr |
  |                                |
  | ml            mc            mr |
  |                                |
  | Bl            Bc            Br |
  |                                |
  | bl            bc            br |
  +--------------------------------+

You will get away with specifying only one or even zero letters in the
argument string. The respective letters default to tl. The -b switch has
been preserved for compatibility reasons; using it is equivalent to "-g bl".
